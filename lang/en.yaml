# About
about_me:
  - I began coding at the age of 13 with Visual Basic. I crafted simple applications as a hobby and shared them online. After 14 years, what started as a hobby has flourished into a career with a keen specialization in front-end engineering with Javascript and Laravel.
  - Dedicated to lifelong learning in software development, I have earned three MCSA certifications from Microsoft, covering essential technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and ASP.Net. My linguistic studies, which resulted in a bachelorâ€™s degree from Istanbul University, have equipped me to effectively communicate complex UI concepts to a broad range of users.
  - My technical proficiency centres on JavaScript,  including its popular frameworks Vue, React and Ionic, further extending to PHP and Laravel for backend operations, accompanied by a diverse toolkit of other technologies.
