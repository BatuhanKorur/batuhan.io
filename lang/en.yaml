  1: >
    I began coding at 13, 
    starting with Visual Basic to make simple applications and sharing them online. 
    Now, 14 years later, my passion has evolved into a career, specializing in web and mobile app development.

    Dedicated to lifelong learning in software development, 
    I have earned three MCSA certifications from Microsoft, 
    covering essential technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and ASP.Net. 
    My linguistic studies, which resulted in a bachelorâ€™s degree from Istanbul University, 
    have equipped me to effectively communicate complex UI concepts to a broad range of users.

    My technical proficiency centres on JavaScript, 
    including its popular frameworks Vue and React, 
    and extends to PHP and Laravel, accompanied by a diverse toolkit of other technologies.
