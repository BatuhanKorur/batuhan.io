			<p class="text-white text-base font-[380]">I began coding at 13, starting with Visual Basic to make simple
				applications and
				sharing
				them online. Now, 14
				years later, my passion has evolved into a career, specializing in web and mobile app development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dedicated to lifelong learning in software development, I have earned three MCSA certifications from Microsoft,
				covering essential technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and ASP.Net.Â My linguistic studies, which
				resulted in aÂ bachelorâ€™sÂ degree from Istanbul University,Â have equipped meÂ to effectively communicate complex UI
				concepts to a broad range of users.Â 

				My technical proficiency centres on JavaScript, including its popular frameworks Vue and React, and extends to
				PHP and Laravel, accompanied by a diverse toolkit of other technologies.
